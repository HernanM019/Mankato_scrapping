Python experimental script used to learn how to automatically scrap some business information.

Working and tested version currently is scrapping_3.py.

Just execute the py file on your favorite IDE of choice and let it run. Should return an Excel file containing relevant data. It took like an hour or so to retrieve the information we required at the time.

This should work with this specific website, however the script should be easily modifiable.

All other script versions are different iterations for the development of this same script. The only one working is scrapping_3.py.

Scrapping_3.5.py should work, but it was NOT tested. Changes between those two versions are minimal.
