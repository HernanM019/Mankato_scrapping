Python experimental script used to learn how to automatically scrap some business information.

Working and tested version currently is scrapping_3.py
Just execute the py file on your favorite IDE of choice and let it run. Should return an Excel file containing relevant data.

This should work with this specific website, however the script should be easily modifiable.
